# Conference Attendance Guidelines

## Requirements

1. To attend a **domestic** conference, the expectation is to publish a 1st author paper.
2. For **international** conferences, a 1st author paper in a high (IF ~ >10) journal is expected. These include: PRL, Nano Letters, ACS Nano, OPTICA, Adv Mater etc. Some journals would fluctuate, but you get the gist.
3. Equal first author contributions count (i.e. both students can count it as first for their own travel).
4. Conference presentation should be a talk, **not a poster**. Gordon conferences (see below) are an exemption.

## Additional Notes

- In both cases, students should present a dry run to the group before arranging (!) travel.
- Students should seek external travel grants (faculty, societies etc).
- For overseas travel, visits to a lab **for research purposes** must be done in conjunction with travel (i.e. not just to say hi).
- It is **expected** that students who are planning to travel overseas will help running our international chapters (SPIE, OPTICA etc).

## Recommended Conferences

**Domestic:** AIP (not AIP summer meeting!), ICONN, ANZCOP, specific workshops.

**International:** CLEO (specially post-deadline), ICPS, ICDS (Physics and Defects of Semiconductors), Gordon conferences (should be top priority for students who want to stay in academia), and dedicated workshops. MRS Fall, SPIE Optics and Photonics and SPIE Europe are OK but not preferred.

## For Postdocs and ECRs

- Expectation is for you to seek your own funding for travel. We would consider paying if you lead the research and/or are a senior/corresponding author and there is an invited talk.
- If you have your own funding, feel free to travel as you see fit.
