# Managing References

Throughout your time in the group, you will be reading many journal articles, PhD theses, textbooks, and experimental equipment user manuals.

When it comes time to write a draft manuscript for a paper, or when writing your thesis, there are a few options available for keeping track of references.

## Professional Presence

Once you start getting published, it is a good idea to setup your own professional presence online, so that others can cite you more easily.

Quite often researchers have at least one of the following:

- [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com.au/)
- [ORCID](https://www.orcid.org)
